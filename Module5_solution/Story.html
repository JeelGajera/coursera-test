                <h3>1. The Secret to Success </h3>
                <p>Once a young man asked the wise man, Socrates,  the secret to success. Socrates patiently listened to the man’s question and told him to meet him near the river the next morning for the answer. The next morning Socrates asked the young man to walk with him towards the river. As they went in the river  the water got up to their neck. But to the young man’s surprise Socrates ducked him into the water.

                    The young man struggled to get out of the water, but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy started turning blue. Socrates pulled the man’s head out of the water. The young man gasps and took a deep breath of air. Socrates asked, ‘What did you want the most when your head was in the water?” The young man replied, “Air.” Socrates said, “That is the secret to success. When you want success as badly as you wanted the air while you were in the water, then you will get it. There is no other secret.”</p>

                <h3>2. The coldest winter</h3>
                <p>It was one of the coldest winter and many animals were dying because of the cold. The porcupines, realizing the situation, decided to group together to keep each other warm. This was a great way to protect themselves from cold and keep each of them warm; but the quills of each one wounded their closest companions.

                    After a while, they decided to distance themselves, but  they too began to die due to cold. So they had to make a choice: either accept the quills of their companions or choose death. Wisely, they decided to go back to being together. They learned to live with the little wounds caused by the close relationship with their companions in order to receive the warmth of their togetherness. This way they were able to survive.</p>

                <h3>3. Meaningless Goals</h3>
                <p>A farmer had a dog who used to wait by the roadside for vehicles to come. As soon as one came, he would run down the road, barking and trying to overtake the vehicle. One day the farmer’s neighbour asked the farmer “Do you think the dog is ever going to overtake those vehicles?” The farmer replied, “That is not what bothers me. What bothers me is what he would do if he ever caught one.”

                    Many people in life behave like that dog who is pursuing meaningless goals.</p>

                <h3>4. A lesson in giving </h3>
                <p>Many years ago, when I worked as a transfusion volunteer at a Hospital, I got to know a little three year old girl who was suffering from a disease. The little girl  needed blood from her five-year-old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease. The boy had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness and was the only hope for his sister.

                    The doctor explained the situation to the little brother, and asked if the boy would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate only for a moment before he took a deep breath and said “ Yes, I will do it if it will save my sister.”
                    
                    As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, seeing the colour returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the nurse beside him and asked with a trembling voice, “When will I start to die?”
                    
                    The young boy had misunderstood the doctor and thought he had to die to save his sick sister.</p>

                <h3>5. Everyone has a Story</h3>
                <p>A young man in his twenties was seeing out from the train’s window shouted…

                    “Father, look at the trees! They are going behind!”
                    
                    The young man’s father smiled at the man and a young couple sitting nearby, looked at the young man’s childish comment with pity.
                    
                    Suddenly, the young man exclaimed again.
                    
                    “Father, look at the clouds! They are all running with us!”
                    
                    The couple couldn’t resist and said to the old man.
                    
                    “Why don’t you take your son to a good doctor?”
                    
                    The old man smiled and said
                    
                    “We did and we are just coming from the hospital. My son was blind from birth and he just got his vision today.”
                    
                    Every  person in the world has a story. Don’t judge people before you truly know them. The truth might surprise you.</p>
